# DeadlineARCADE
### REQUIRES iCalFeed REPO AS WELL
clone iCal then in the same directory, clone this.
rough file structure:
``` bash
/path/to/repos/iCalFeed
/path/to/repos/DeadlineARCADE
```
This is achieved by cloning iCal first due to the symlink dependencies.


Takes an ARCADE deadline file (UoM CS) and a course code and returns how long until the next deadline
